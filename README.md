# Armand's Discord Bots

![Project Build](https://github.com/ArmandBernard/DiscordBots/actions/workflows/on-push.yml/badge.svg)

This is a repo for all my Discord bots.

It's written in Node.js and uses TypeScript.

## What I'm making

The following bots are already working:

- RatBot: A bot that looks out of the word rat, and comments a rat gif if it sees it
- WeatherBot: Tells you the current weather for a given city
- WordCounter: A bot that tells you how many times a word has been said.

The following is upcoming:

- Improvements to the WordCounter:
  - Count of usages alongside count of messages
