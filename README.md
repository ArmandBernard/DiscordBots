# Armand's Discord Bots

This is a repo for all my Discord bots.

It's written in Node.js and uses TypeScript.

## Status

![Project Build](https://github.com/ArmandBernard/DiscordBots/actions/workflows/node.yml/badge.svg)

## What I'm making

The following bots are already working:

- RatBot: A bot that looks out of the word rat, and comments a rat gif if it sees it
- WeatherBot: Tells you the current weather for a given city

I plan to make the following bots in the future:

- WordCounter: A bot that tells you how many times you've used a (bad) word.
