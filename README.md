# Armand's Discord Bots

This is a repo for all my Discord bots.

It's written in Node.js and uses TypeScript.

I plan on adding test later too.

Current planned is:

- ratBot: a bot that looks out of the word rat, and comments a rat gif if it sees it
- naughtyWordFinder: a bot that tells you how many times you've used a (bad) word.
